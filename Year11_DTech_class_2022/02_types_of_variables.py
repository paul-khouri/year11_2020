# variables have 'type' of data


# this will be an integer 
num_a = 21

# this will be a  float (decimal)
num_b = 37.896

# this is a string, just the characters of the number
string_a = "458"

#another string
string_b = "Good morning"


# this is a boolean (true or false)
my_b = True

#some variables cannot be used together
my_sum = num_a + num_b
print(my_sum)

my_sum = string_b + string_a
print(my_sum)

# this gives an error
#my_sum = num_a + string_a

# we can change types, which we need to do sometimes
# this is called casting
